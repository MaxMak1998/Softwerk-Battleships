Softwerk Assignment README.

Instructions:
1) Import project into Unity
2) Run "Main Menu" Scene

Unfortunatly, due to poor time management, I did not manage to implement everything I wanted. Given more time, I would:
1) Create Tests! (Should have written them as I was adding features, not trying to fit everything at the end)
2) Add music and soundeffects
3) During the "Battle" Scene, show ships as images, rather than grey squares (this was done, due to a number of issues that were not solved in time)
3) Pause and settings option
4) Option to play agains a computer
